-- The subgraph's `SubgraphDeployment` figures, one row per deployment that ever had an allocation or
-- any signal (nuthatch#1160, group B: `api/subgraph-deployments`, `api/subgraph-fees-30d`,
-- `api/subgraph-search`, the subgraph OpenGraph image). Names live on IPFS behind graph-gns-nest's
-- metadata hashes; this view is the on-chain half and is joined to them in Lodestar.
--
-- `signalled_tokens` follows `lodestar_allocations`' signal CTE (net of the curation tax, plus query
-- fees collected into the pool, less burns). `query_fees_amount` is the indexers' net query fees on the
-- deployment, per the `fees` CTE below. `staked_tokens` is active allocation.
-- `created_at` is the first block anything touched the deployment: its first allocation or its first
-- signal, whichever came first; the subgraph dates it from its first appearance the same way.
-- `active_allocation_count` and `curator_count` are the lengths the gateway path counted (the latter
-- counting exited positions too, as the subgraph's list does).
