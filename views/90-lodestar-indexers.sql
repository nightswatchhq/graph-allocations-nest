-- Lodestar's `Indexer`, `DelegatedStake`, `Curator` and `Provision` shapes, folded from events
-- (nuthatch#1160, the surfaces #1078 left: `api/indexers`, `api/indexer/[address]`,
-- `api/indexer-stake-history`, `api/rewards-history`, `api/curators`, `api/provisions`,
-- `api/portfolio`, `api/apr-provenance`, `lib/refresh.ts`, the indexer OpenGraph image).
--
-- Every modelling choice here is the one `80-lodestar-network.sql` already made and measured against
-- the gateway, applied per entity instead of summed: stake nets deposits, withdrawals and legacy
-- slashing; a delegation leaves the pool at the *exit* event (`StakeDelegatedLocked` before Horizon,
-- `TokensUndelegated` after), not at withdrawal; "active" is shares, not tokens. Where this view has
-- to say something the network view did not, the paragraph above the CTE says what and why, and the
-- parity run against the subgraph arbitrates rather than the reasoning.
--
-- Units: `*_tokens` and `*_shares` are wei as HUGEINT; cuts are parts per million as the contracts
-- emit them; addresses are lower-cased; `id` follows the subgraph (the address, or `delegator-indexer`).

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The per-indexer ledger: one row per event that moved an indexer's own stake or its delegation
-- pool, with the block time, so a caller can state either figure *as of any moment* by summing rows
-- up to it (`api/indexer-stake-history` wants 27 weekly points; the subgraph answered those with
-- block-pinned queries). `lodestar_indexers` sums this same ledger, so the two cannot disagree.
--
-- `pool_delta` follows the model measured exact against `getDelegationPool` on every indexer: the
-- delegation events themselves, the explicit pool additions, the legacy-era delegator reward share
-- computed per `RewardsAssigned` from the cut in force (contract rounding, skipped when the pool was
-- empty), and the silent share on legacy allocations closed after the upgrade. Thawing is not in
-- `pool_delta`: summed over every indexer that is the subgraph's `totalDelegatedTokens` to the wei.
-- The subgraph's per-indexer `delegatedTokens` *does* include thawing (P2P: 158,046,448 GRT, equal to
-- `getDelegationPool().tokens`), so `thawing_delta` runs beside it - up at `TokensUndelegated`, down
-- at `DelegatedTokensWithdrawn` - and an as-of caller adds the two for that figure.

-- Per (delegator, indexer): the subgraph's `DelegatedStake`, including its accounting.

-- Shares are exact and were measured against `getDelegation` (top 60, all equal). The token value
-- of a position is its share of the pool, `shares * pool_tokens / pool_shares`, as the contracts
-- value it. The rest follows `staking.ts` / `horizonStaking.ts` in the network subgraph:
--   * `personal_exchange_rate` is the delegator's weighted-average price per share, updated on every
--     delegation as (rate * shares + tokens_in) / (shares + shares_in), unchanged by undelegation;
--   * `realized_rewards` accrues on every undelegation as tokens_out - shares_out * rate, i.e. what
--     the position was worth at exit minus what it cost, and `TokensUndelegated.tokens` *is* the
--     exit value so no pool rate is needed.
-- That is a sequential fold per position, done with `list_reduce` over the position's events in
-- block order; the rate and realized rewards are DOUBLEs, which at 1e24 wei is a 1e-10 GRT error,
-- the subgraph's own BigDecimals are truncated to 18 places, and no on-chain oracle exists for either
-- (they are bookkeeping, not state). `locked_tokens` is undelegated and not yet withdrawn, both eras;
-- `locked_until` is the newest Horizon thaw request's `thawingUntil`, a Unix time, and 0 for a legacy
-- lock, whose 28-day thaw expired long ago and which is withdrawable now - the pages compare this
-- field to the clock, so a block number here would be wrong in a way that looks right.
