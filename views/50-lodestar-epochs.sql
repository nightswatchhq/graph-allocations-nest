-- Lodestar's `SubgraphEpoch` shape (RFC-0011), served from events.
--
-- **The trap this view exists to avoid.** `EpochManager.epochLength` is 7,200, and the obvious move is
-- `start_block = anchor + (epoch - anchor_epoch) * 7200`. That is wrong on Arbitrum, and wrong by a
-- factor of ~48: inside an Arbitrum contract `block.number` returns the **L1** block number, so
-- EpochManager counts epochs in L1 blocks, while the `block_number` on an indexed log is **L2**.
-- Computing it gave 60,142 epochs where the network has 1,356.
--
-- `EpochRun` cannot rescue it either - it has fired **once** in the entire history, because running an
-- epoch is optional and nobody bothers.
--
-- So boundaries are derived from what the events themselves report. `AllocationCreated` and
-- `IndexingRewardsCollected` both carry `currentEpoch` alongside their L2 block, which is a direct
-- (epoch, L2 block) observation and needs no L1/L2 mapping at all. Our max epoch from these is 1,356,
-- which is exactly what the network subgraph reports.

-- **The boundaries, read off EpochManager's own arithmetic rather than guessed from events.**
--
-- The header above is still right that `start = anchor + (epoch - anchor_epoch) * 7200` is wrong in
-- L2 block space. It is exactly right in **L1** block space, which is the space EpochManager counts
-- in. Read at the tip, the contract reports `epochLength()` 7200, `lastLengthUpdateBlock()`
-- 16687937 and `lastLengthUpdateEpoch()` 92, so
--
--     epoch(l1) = 92 + (l1 - 16687937) // 7200
--
-- and because the last length update was at epoch 92, one linear segment covers this whole range -
-- no piecewise reconstruction. That formula reproduces `currentEpoch()` exactly at six L2 blocks
-- spanning 400M to 501M, and `currentEpochBlock()` returns 25889537, which is precisely the
-- formula's L1 start for epoch 1370. The contract agrees with the arithmetic about its own boundary.
--
-- The L1 boundary is then mapped to L2 by binary-searching for the first L2 block whose header
-- `l1BlockNumber` reaches it: 5,407 block fetches for all 266 boundaries, against the 459 million
-- an indexed `blocks` table would cost (RFC-0036 §4.2 fetches every block in the window, by design).
-- Every sampled boundary was checked against the contract: `currentEpoch()` returns E at the
-- boundary block and E-1 at the block before it. See nightswatchhq/nuthatch#1116.
--
-- **This table is static and spans epochs 1105 to 1370.** Epochs outside it fall back to the observed
-- derivation below and are labelled as such, so the view degrades rather than lying. Extending it is
-- a rerun of the same search; making it self-maintaining is the `l1_block_number` work in #1116.
