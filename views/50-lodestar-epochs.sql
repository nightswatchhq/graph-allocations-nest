-- Lodestar's `SubgraphEpoch` shape (RFC-0011), served from events.
--
-- **The trap this view exists to avoid.** Inside an Arbitrum contract `block.number` is the **L1**
-- block, so EpochManager counts epochs in L1 blocks while a log's `block_number` is **L2**. Computing
-- epochs in L2 block space is wrong by a factor of ~48 (60,142 epochs where the network has 1,356).
--
-- So every block this nest holds is placed by its own `l1_block_number` (`[extract] l1_blocks`),
-- with EpochManager's arithmetic: within a length segment that began at L1 block `anchor` in epoch
-- `e0` with length `len`, `epoch(l1) = e0 + (l1 - anchor) // len`. The segments are the
-- `EpochLengthUpdate` events. The first (initialize) sets `anchor` to its own L1 block; each later one
-- re-anchors at `currentEpochBlock()`, the start of the epoch it fired in, which is the previous
-- anchor plus whole epochs of the previous length. On Arbitrum One that gives epoch 1 at L1
-- 16,083,151 with length 6,646, then epoch 92 at L1 16,687,937 with length 7,200, which are the
-- contract's `lastLengthUpdateEpoch()`, `lastLengthUpdateBlock()` and `epochLength()` at the tip.
--
-- An epoch's `start_block` is the first L2 block this nest holds in it, not the chain's first L2
-- block of the epoch: only log-bearing blocks carry an L1 number here. Bucketing by it is still
-- exact, because L1 numbers never decrease along L2, so every row of the nest falls in the epoch its
-- own block's L1 number says. `start_l1_block` and `end_l1_block` are the epoch's exact L1 range,
-- the numbers the network subgraph reports as `startBlock` and `endBlock`. See
-- nuthatch-org/nuthatch#1116 and #1882.
