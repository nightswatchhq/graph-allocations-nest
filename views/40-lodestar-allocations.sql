-- Lodestar's `SubgraphAllocation` shape, served from events instead of the gateway (RFC-0011).

-- Maps one-for-one onto the interface at `lodestar/src/lib/ingest/allocations.ts:7`, so the route can
-- read this and stop calling `subgraphQuery`. Twelve of its thirteen fields come from two contracts;
-- the thirteenth is noted below and is the only thing this view guesses at, which it refuses to do.
